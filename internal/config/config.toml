AboutDescription =  "I send letters to the future. How it works? You send me a letter that you want to receive on some specific date in the future. Then, you will be given the opportunity to indicate your email to which you would like to receive the same message. Keep in mind that after the process of sending my letter, I will delete it from the chat in order to maintain the intrigue and give your brain the opportunity to forget about it! You leave a hundred dollars in your winter jacket and happily forget about them, and after a season you put it on and wow, wow - you feel those same dollars and rejoice! The principle is similar here). To start, call the /start or /open command."
